# Measure Three-Phase Electric Circuit Impedance Using Sinestream Signal Generator Block

This example shows how to use the [Sinestream Signal Generator block](https://www.mathworks.com/help/slcontrol/ug/sinestreamsignalgenerator.html) to inject a 
sinestream input signal that measures the three-phase electric circuit impedance through an offline frequency response estimation experiment.
In practice, you can use this approach to perform the experiment in real-time against a physical plant. In this example, you perform the experiment
on a plant modeled in SimulinkÂ®.


## Setup
Run the livescript 'MeasureThreePhaseElectricCircuitImpedanceUsingSinestreamExample.mlx'. Ensure you have the necessary MATLAB&reg; toolboxes installed (mentioned below).
