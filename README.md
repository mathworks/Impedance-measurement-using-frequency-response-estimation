[![View <File Exchange Title> on File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/images/matlab-file-exchange.svg)](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/####-file-exchange-title)  

This submission is designed to showcase a workflow for measuring impedance using frequency response estimation techniques. 
The examples provided herein are intended for engineers, researchers, and practitioners who are involved in the characterization and analysis of electrical components and systems.
This repository offers a practical guide on how to utilize MATLAB&reg; and Simulink&reg; tools to derive impedance measurements effectively by using the following examples:
    1)Estimate Battery Impedance Using Signal Generator Blocks
    2)Analyze Battery Impedance Using Exact Linearization
    3)Meaure Three-Phase Electric Circuit Impedance Using Sinestream Signal Generator Block


## Getting started
To get started with these examples, clone or download this repository to your MATLAB&reg; environment. Step through the livescript in each example folder to execute the impedance
measurement process. Ensure you have the necessary MATLAB&reg; toolboxes installed (mentioned below).
